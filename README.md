# -Python-Point-Ward-Mapping-Automation-
Developed a Python script using leveraging geopandas to efficiently match 1000 points with their corresponding wards in Nigeria, streamlining data integration and analysis and exporting results to an excel sheet for informedÂ decision-making

## Data
- Data contains 1,000 coordinate randomly distributed across Nigeria

## Features

- Loads geographic coordinates from a CSV file.
- Converts the coordinates into a GeoDataFrame for spatial analysis.
- Supports visualization of point data using Folium.
- Includes spatial analysis libraries such as Pandas, GeoPandas, and Folium.

## Results
After running the notebook, the output includes:

- A GeoPandas DataFrame that contains the input points with their respective geographic coordinates.
- Visualizations created using Folium, which allow for interactive mapping of the points.
- A color-coded map displaying the ward boundaries and the location of each point on the map.
- The result is a fully interactive map that provides spatial insights into how these points align with administrative boundaries (wards) within Nigeria.
- efficiently match 1000 points with their corresponding wards in Nigeria provided in a csv file
